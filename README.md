# Node.js Crash Course

This repository is a collection of everything I learned about node.js (excluding frameworks) such as the fs module, path module, URL & http module as well. Each file is heavily commented out as a way for me to understand each single line of code.

# NPM packages installed:
- nodemon
cmd: npm develop

This repo is for future reference in case my files have been deleted or I need a sharable reference.
